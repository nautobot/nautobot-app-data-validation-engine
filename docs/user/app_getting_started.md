# Getting Started with the App

A step-by-step tutorial on how to get the App going and how to use it.

## Install the App

To install the App, please follow the instructions detailed in the [Installation Guide](../admin/install.md).

## First steps with the App

One the App is installed, under "Plugins" tab, you will find the supported Data Validation Engine rules. For example, "Min/Max Rules", or "Regex Rule".

There you can list the existing validation rules of each type, or create them (one by one, or dumping them).

!!!note
    The validation rules only take effect for new data entries, not for previous existing data. So, when you create a new object, for instance, a `ipam.VLAN`, is when the existing validation rules will be enforced.
